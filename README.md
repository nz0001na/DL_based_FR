# A survey on deep learning based face recognition
Some materials for paper 'A survey on deep learning based face recognition'

# Abstract
Deep learning, in particular the deep convolutional neural networks, has received increasing interests
in face recognition recently, and a number of deep learning methods have been proposed. This paper
summarizes about 330 contributions in this area. It reviews major deep learning concepts pertinent
to face image analysis and face recognition, and provides a concise overview of studies on specific
face recognition problems, such as handling variations in pose, age, illumination, expression, and
heterogeneous face matching. A summary of databases used for deep face recognition is given as
well. Finally, some open challenges and directions are discussed for future research.

This repository contains main papers/slides for the survey paper.
• This survey presents a comprehensive overview of about 330 face recognition works using deep learning within the recent years
• It shows that:
✔ DL has been fully applied to FR and plays important roles;
✔ Many specific issues or challenges have been addressed in FR by DL, e.g., pose, illumination, expression, 3D, heterogenous
matching;
✔ Various face datasets have been collected in recent years, including still images, videos, and heterogeneous data.
