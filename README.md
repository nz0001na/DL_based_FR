![arch](png/abstract.png)

This repository contains main papers/slides for the survey paper.
• This survey presents a comprehensive overview of about 330 face recognition works using deep learning within the recent years
• It shows that:
✔ DL has been fully applied to FR and plays important roles;
✔ Many specific issues or challenges have been addressed in FR by DL, e.g., pose, illumination, expression, 3D, heterogenous
matching;
✔ Various face datasets have been collected in recent years, including still images, videos, and heterogeneous data.
